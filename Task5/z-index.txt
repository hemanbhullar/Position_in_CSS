The z-index property
When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).

An element can have a positive or negative stack order.

Example:
<html>
<head>
<style>
img {
    positionL absolute;
    left: 0px;
    top: 0px;
    z-index:-1;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1> This is heading </h1>
<img src = "img.png">
<p>Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text.</p>

</body>
</html>
