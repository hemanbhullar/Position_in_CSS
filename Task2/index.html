    <title>Difference Between Absolute and Relative Positiioning</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Absolute:</h1>
    <p>Elements that are relative positioned remain in the normal flow of the document. In contrast, an element that is absolutely positioned is taken out of the flow; thus, other elements are positioned as if it did not exist. The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor( i.e., the nearest ancestor that is not static). If a positioned ancestor doesn't exist, it is positioned relative to the ICB(initial containing block) , which is the containing block of the document's root element.</p>
    <h1>Relative:</h1>
    <p>Relative Positioned element is an element whose computed position value is relative. The top and the bottom properties specify the vertical offset from its normal position; the left and right properties specify the horizontal offset</p>
    <p>The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.</p>
